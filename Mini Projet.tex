\section*{\Huge CHAPTER 1\vspace{0.5cm}\\Requirements Specification}
\vspace{1.5cm}

{\Large \textbf{1.1\hspace{1em}Introduction}}\vspace{0.2cm}
\\In this part of our chapter, we'll dig into the details of what our project needs. This means figuring out what it should do (functional requirements), how it should perform (non-functional requirements), and who will use it (actors). Then, we'll create a simple diagram (the global use case diagram) to show how everything fits together. This diagram will help us understand how different parts of our project interact. Finally, we'll talk about our backlog product along with our work environment(Project Management Methodology/Software environment), which is a list of tasks and features we need to prioritize. By doing all this, we'll make sure we're on track to meet our project's goals.\vspace{0.5cm}
\\{\Large \textbf{1.2\hspace{1em}Requirements Identification}}\vspace{0.2cm}
\\The requirements specification is crucial for building a product. It outlines how the system should work and any limitations on its design. By establishing these guidelines upfront, we ensure that the development team creates a product that meets the customers' needs. Functional requirements describe what the system should do, while non-functional requirements focus on how it should perform. Together, these requirements provide a clear roadmap for product development, ensuring that the end result aligns with customer expectations and functions effectively.\vspace{0.5cm}
\\{\large \textbf{1.2.1\hspace{1em}Functional requirements}}\vspace{0.2cm}
\\Functional requirements, often referred to as the functional specification, serve as a comprehensive set of guidelines detailing the primary objectives of the system and how it serves its users. These requirements highlight the core functionalities that the development team needs to implement throughout the development process. By clearly defining what the system must accomplish, functional requirements enable the team to monitor their progress effectively and ensure that they're on track to meet the project's goals.\vspace{0.1cm}

\vspace{0.5cm}
{\large \textbf{1.2.2\hspace{1em}Non-Functional requirements}}
\vspace{0.2cm}
\\Non-functional requirements, in contrast to functional ones, delineate the various attributes and characteristics of the developed system while it executes its use cases. They primarily focus on aspects such as security, portability, usability, and more, essentially setting the standards for how well the functional requirements should be met. These requirements are critical as they ensure that the system operates within predefined parameters and meets user expectations regarding performance and quality. Although the system may technically still function without adhering strictly to non-functional requirements, it would likely fall short in meeting the overall needs and desires of both the owner and the end-user. Thus, it is imperative to prioritize and fulfill these requirements to deliver a successful and satisfactory product.\vspace{0.1cm}
\begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$]
	\item Security and Safety :\vspace{0.1cm}
\\- The app must encrypt user's password and ensure the Security of his account with MFA.
\\- The app should ensure user's Safety by blocking sensitive contents and ban suspiscious users.
	\item Easy to use : \vspace{0.1cm}
\\- The app should provide usability for everybody regardless his knowledge in technology.
\\- Provide a tutorial for who use the app for the first time.
	\item Maintainable\vspace{0.1cm}
\\- The app should runs smoothly.
\\- The app should remain reliable and functions effectively.
	\item Availability\vspace{0.1cm}
\\- The app should be accessible to everyone.
\\- The app should be available  24/7 to users.

\\The backlog product is a prioritized list of tasks essential for developing the project, structured according to the levels necessary to meet system requirements. This hierarchical organization ensures that the most critical tasks are placed at the top level, enabling the development team to identify and focus on delivering them first. By following this approach, the team can streamline their efforts, ensuring that the project progresses in alignment with the system's overarching goals and priorities.\vspace{0.8cm}

{\Large \textbf{1.5\hspace{1em}Work environment}}\vspace{0.2cm}\\
In pursuit of our project goals, we've embraced the Agile methodology, specifically Scrum, along with employing various software tools. This approach allows us to adapt quickly to changing requirements, collaborate effectively as a team, and deliver high-quality results efficiently. By leveraging Agile principles and utilizing the right software, we're confident in our ability to achieve our objectives with flexibility and innovation.\vspace{0.2cm}\\
{\large \textbf{1.5.1\hspace{1em}Project Management Methodology}}
\\Scrum is a form of agile project management. You can think of it more like a framework than as a project management methodology in itself.
With Scrum, work is split into short cycles known as “sprints”, which usually last about 1-2 weeks. Work is taken from the backlog for each sprint iteration,
Small teams are led by a Scrum Master (who is not the same as the project manager) for the duration of the sprint, after which they review their performance in a “sprint retrospective” and make any necessary changes before starting the next sprint.

{\Large \textbf{1.6\hspace{1em}Conclusion}}\vspace{0.2cm}\\
In our first chapter, we began by thoroughly detailing the requirements specification process, followed by identifying the actors involved in our system. We then simplified these findings into a concise diagram for easy understanding. Transitioning to our methodology, we highlighted our utilization of the agile Scrum approach for effective project management. Lastly, we rounded off by outlining the software tools integral to our project's development and organization.
